**General Idea**
When applying for undergraduate universities/colleges, applicants normally face an overwhelming amount of information regarding different schools. To make the process more efficient and information more accessible, we aim to develop a web application that allows students to filter the universities by various factors, including admission criteria, tuition and geographical locations. More importatnly, we intend to tell the applicants where they stand in the pool (e.g., higher than 75% of applicants in the past years) based on their SAT/ACT scores. 

Our app functions in a very simple way: applicants just need to input their personal information (academic grades, financial budget, regional preferences, etc.), and the app will recommend a list of schools satisfying their requirements.

We hope this app could give applicants a more clear view of the schools that match them, thus helping them make informed decisions. 

All the data related to universities are obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics(NCES, https://nces.ed.gov/).

**Anticipated Stack**
We plan to rely on AWS RDS to host our database for US universities and use nodeJS to connect the database (query the information) and webpages (take user input).
